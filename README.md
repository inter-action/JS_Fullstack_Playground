# ABOUT THIS REPO
this project serves a playground for me to experiment JavaScript fullstack techniques.

main checkpoints I planed to implement:
* typescript
* koajs@2.0
* mysql with knex
* unit test all the way
* functional test (some)
* docker from all the way (from dev to production)
* redis cache
* reactjs server rendering with nextjs
* RxJS, react-router
* logging
* health checking point

other low priorities checkpoints:
* JWT & Outh2
* Sketch design

all the notes in this process would reside in docs/ directory.

# ABOUT THIS REPO
this project serves a playground for me to experiment JavaScript fullstack techniques.

## main checkpoints I planed to implement:
dev:
* typescript âœ“
* koajs@2.0
* mysql with knex
* unit test all the way
* functional test (some)
* docker from all the way (from dev to production)
* redis cache
* reactjs server rendering with nextjs
* RxJS, react-router
* logging
* i18n

production checkpoints:
* health checking point
* load balancing with docker
* cloud deployment
* error notification via emails
* nodejs memory dump
* online monitor

security:


other low priorities checkpoints:
* JWT & Outh2
* Sketch design

all the notes in this process would reside in docs/ directory.


# notes
* this repo includes my vscode editor settings, which may not be what u like, also note that in case 
you're surprised by some wired stuff, assume you're using vscode ofc, I suggest u take look at it.

# compatiblitiy
* node > 4.x ,  typescript async support requires it
